Year of manufacture
Model
Other relevant features
User-friendly web interface built with Flask.
Accurate predictions using a trained Machine Learning model.



-->Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas and numpy for data handling and manipulation
scikit-learn for Machine Learning model building
Flask for building the web interface
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and analysis
Deployment: Flask web framework
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various used cars, including:

Car company
Year of manufacture
